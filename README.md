"Howdy, Universe. This is my (TyLynOl) first HTML/CSS project. The objective is to deconstruct the Google homepage and rebuild it in a HTML file. I will attempt to use the browser's developer tools to familiarize myself with the layout, and then use the tools to access key elements in reconstructing the web page. In completing this project, I hope to gain confidence in using a browser's developer tools to quickly locate key elements, and to gain familiarity of the Git workflow." (2/23/20)
